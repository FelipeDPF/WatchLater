<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Open Demo](https://github.com/FelipeDPF/WatchLater/blob/master/demo.gif)

I just love movies, so I decided to create a web application that allows me search for the movies that I would like to watch next and them to my watchlist. 

Here's why: 
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)

### Features
I am currently working and adding other features, but so far this web application allows you to: 
* Search movies by the title
* Add multiple movies to your watchlist
* View your customized movie list and remove movies from your list
